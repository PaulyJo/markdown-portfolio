*Am a total geek and get life from studying new concepts, reading articles on subjects I excelled at in my professional career like __Lean Six Sigma__, **statistics**, _process improvement_, and the like!
**WAAAAYYYY** back in the day when I was working towards my BSEE, I remember learning _Basic_ programming and UNIX and the technology that was hot back then un/around 1996 give or take....at least if my memory serves me right it was indeed Basic...
At this point in my undergrad stage of pife I was trying to determine what part of EE subject matter I wanted to learn more about and Basic was soooo....daunting and abstract to me, I swore off programming.  **_YET_** over 20+ years later here I am!  Learning the software side of things and coding to boot on my own!
__I started out initially focusing my training on Java__, but....as I start to get the hang of it, I feel I need to bring another language on deck for a dual focus so I am leaning toward Python.  By learning Python as well I should be able to utilize my strong statistics background with me on this coding journey, finding it a home amongst my new tools.
